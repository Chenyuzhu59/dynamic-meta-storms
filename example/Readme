#Here we provide a demo dataset with species abundance of
#40 synthetic metagenomic samples in 4 different Groups.
#
#File description
#dataset1.sp.abd: relative abundance of species.
#dataset1.meta: group information of the samples.
#
#To run the demo, you can either
#
#sh Readme
#
#or
#type the following command
#
#Commands
MS-comp-taxa-dynamic -T dataset1.sp.abd -o dataset1.sp.abd.dist
#
#Output description
#dataset1.sp.abd.dist: Pairwise distance of the 40 samples
#
